## In a Nutshell

 Let's discover and track disease outbreaks with Data Science and Python! A repository consisting of Jupyter Notebooks and 650 rows of News Headlines data.

## Setup

This project requires Python 3.7 installed with the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

To install the required libraries in a new virtual environment, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` from the project root 
directory. This will install the  libraries into a virtual env that can be activated with `conda activate discovering-disease-outbreaks`. 

The data is located at `data/headlines.txt`. Run `jupyter notebook` to start a Jupyter Notebook and get coding!
